## üöÄ How to Run Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the files):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nenseso/LoveCard-Studio.git
    cd lovecard-studio
    ```

2.  **Start a local web server**. Since browsers have security restrictions for local files (`file:///...`), you need a server to run the application correctly. The easiest way is to use Python's built-in server.

    - If you have Python 3 installed, run this command in the project directory:
      ```bash
      python3 -m http.server 8080
      ```
    - If you have Python 2, use this command instead:
      ```bash
      python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
      ```

3.  **Open in your browser**:
    Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to the following address:
    [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

That's it! You can now use the LoveCard Studio.
